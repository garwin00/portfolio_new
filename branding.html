            <h3>My identity as a designer</h3>

            <p>How do designers design for themselves? That's the question I was asked when I first started this project for University. The answer was slightly more involved that I initially thought. At first we were tasked with designing a logo, wordmark and visual marque along with a set of brand guidelines for ourselves, but I decided to take it a little bit further with colour variations and visual extensions, like wallpapers and patterns.</p>

            <h3>The problems</h3>
            
            <p>The biggest, most glaring problem was that personal branding was something that I, as a designer, was in dire need of. I'll admit, I was dreading this project, I'd experimented with monograms in the past and found matching the G letterform to literally anything a struggle, nevermind something as linear as an I. Additionally, despite my previous attempts, I'd never made something that I would have been confident showing off. But, with deadlines appreoaching, it was time to knuckle down and just make stuff</p>
            
            <h3>The process</h3>

            <p>With all of my projects, I start out just getting as many ideas our of my head and onto paper as possible. This was no exception. Working on paper is great because it's quick and easy to get a feel for what you might want to go with in the end. For the monogram I had some initial ideas but then chose to just put as many down as I possibly could. I had an a3 sheet with 20 boxes, and had a monogram for each. It didn't matter if they were good or bad, at this point they were just basic and in need of fleshing out.</p>
            
            <div class="placeholder"></div>

            <p>Next came first mockups. The first steps into software are alwasys daunting, you never know what it will actually look like. My chosen idea was heavily abstracted and almost looks like an ambigram, which I thought was pretty cool, and was actually quite easy to come up with. I think in the past I was overcomplicating things and that was my downfall. After decided on the monogram I was going to use, I just played around with things to see what it would look like with different thicknesses, corner profiles, containers and all that good stuff.</p>

            <p>Now that the monogram was decided, I had to come up with an accompanying wordmark. Most people would have struggled with this, but I already had an idea of what I was going to do. I simply chose uppercase Gotham with some letter spacing, a personal favourite of mine. I didn't really feel like chopping it up would suit, I like to keep things simple and that's as simple as it gets.</p>
            
            <img src="img/monocs3.jpg" height="320px" width="480px">
            
            <p>The Visual marque was slightly more involved than the rest of them. I became obsessed with finding something that represents me. I went through all of my hobbies and tried to loosely find a connecting between a distingusing feature of mine. Mouse with a hat? Check. Drumsticks with a beard? Check. In the end I just decided to create a stylished silhouette of myself featuring my two most distinguishing features - a hat and my beard. I then came up with the idea of giving it a loose g shape. Early iterations weren't great.</p>
            
            <img src="img/monocs4.jpg" height="320px" width="480px">
            
            <p>The shape of the beard was all wrong, it wasn't me. I ended up taking a picture of my face and then using that shape to draw the beard.</p>
            
            <p>There's still a ton of issues with the visual marque - the hat being too angulr in comparison to the beard shape for example - and I'm not totally happy with it but I still think it looks kinda cool.</p>
            
            <h3>The outcome</h3>
            <h3>Normally I'd be building a gallery here but it's 1am and I've just decided I've scrapping this layout in favour of something better</h3>
            <h3>Please don't hate me</h3>
