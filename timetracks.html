        <p>What if you could listen to music released on a certain day of every year all the way back? That was my idea for Timetracks. Yes, I know it needs a new name, I suck at naming stuff. The premise was cool though, open the app on any day and you can listen to music released that day, or go back in time. Sounds like a cool way to discover new music right? </p>

    <h3 class="white">The Problem</h3>
    <p class="white">There's plenty of ways to listen to music out there, but there's no really cool ways to discover music. I wanted to change that. In terms of design, most of these apps are visually similar, and function the same way. It's time to see if there's something different.</p>

    <h3 class="blue_text">Process - from paper to screen</h3>
    <p>Starting on paper, I found that I was just drawing out similar designs to already existing services. How could I do things different? Central to the design was the wheel, so I chose to keep all controls near to it for ease of use.</p>

    <p>With an idea and an outline of how the core functionality should work, it was into software to see what I could do.</p>
    <img src="img/soloscreen.jpg">
    <p>The app design itself is nothing revolutionary, but how it functions I think is pretty cool.</p>
    <img src="img/wheeldemo.jpg">
    <p>Pressing and rotating the wheel will fade the rest of the content out and display the year dividers, and picking a year will automatically play songs from today's date on that year. Additionally, there's both favourite and playlist functionality, so you can save songs you like. At the minute, this exists only as an idea and some screens, but I've got plans to flesh out and prototype in future. Also, with the recent streaming update for watchOS, I think this could be quite cool on an Apple Watch. Check back soon to see updates.</p>
